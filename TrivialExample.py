"""
A very simple model which illustrates the basis of creating a model.

An instance of the model is created specifying it will run for 10 epochs.

A class is defined for a SimpleAgent which, in the prologue, outputs its
name. In the epilogue, it outputs the model property counter.

A helper is created which once at the end of each epoch increases the counter
by 1.

Finally, two SimpleAgents and an instance of the helper are added to the
schedule and the model is run.
